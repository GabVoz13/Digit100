              <figcaption>As a group we decided to do a scaniverse scan of the Penn State Behrend lion statue outside of Junker. In the scan we captured the lion, the lion plaque, the foliage around the lion and the junker center sign. We collectively worked together, not one person did anything themselves, we all traded off on turns such as the scanning the lion, the annotations, the pictures and the researching for the annotations.</figcaption>
