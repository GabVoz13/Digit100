                <p>Hi, I’m a creative and detail-oriented student with a passion for learning and exploring new things. I enjoy balancing my schoolwork with creative projects and problem-solving, and I thrive in comfortable, organized environments, even when things get busy. I’m also interested in design, especially modern and vintage styles, and I’m always on the lookout for new opportunities to grow and challenge myself.</p>
