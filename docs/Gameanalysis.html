                <p>"I've always felt alone my whole life,
                    
                    for as long as I can remember.
                    
                    I don't know if I like it... or if I'm just
                    
                    used to it, but I do know this:
                    
                    Being lonely does things to you, and feeling shit and bitter
                    
                    and angry all the time just... eats away at you."</p>
