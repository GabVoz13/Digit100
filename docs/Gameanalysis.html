                    <p><em>Cry of Fear</em> is a psychological survival horror game released in 2012
                        as a standalone mod for <b>Half-Life</b>. Developed by the indie team
                            <b>Team Psykskallar</b>, it combines classic horror elements with modern
                        narrative techniques to deliver an unforgettable experience. The game is
                        praised for its haunting atmosphere, deeply emotional story, and innovative
                        use of limited resources and survival mechanics. It’s also notable for being
                        free-to-play and developed by a small team. <em>Cry of Fear</em> uses its
                        narrative, gameplay mechanics, and atmosphere to immerse players in a world
                        of dread and psychological tension.</p>

                            <p>Simon wakes up in a distorted city, where he faces terrifying
                                monsters and bizarre visions. As the story unfolds, Simon discovers
                                memories of a troubled childhood and strained relationships,
                                particularly with his mother. The central mystery is whether Simon
                                can escape the horrors of both the city and his mind. Sara, a
                                mysterious woman, plays a key role in Simon’s emotional journey, but
                                her true purpose is revealed as the story progresses.</p>

                                <li><strong>Trauma & Mental Health:</strong> The game delves deeply
                                    into Simon’s psychological breakdown, showcasing how trauma can
                                    distort perception and shape one’s reality.</li>
                                <li><strong>Guilt & Redemption:</strong> Simon grapples with guilt
                                    over his past actions and seeks redemption, although the outcome
                                    is ambiguous.</li>
                                <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Both physically and emotionally,
                                    Simon is cut off from the world, highlighting his inner
                                    loneliness and mental disarray.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reality vs. Illusion:</strong> The blurred line between
                                    reality and illusion reflects Simon’s deteriorating mental
                                    state, forcing the player to question what is real.</li>

                                <li><strong>Monsters:</strong> Represent Simon’s inner demons—his
                                    guilt, fear, and unresolved trauma.</li>
                                <li><strong>The City:</strong> A symbolic representation of Simon’s

                                <li><strong>Sara:</strong> Initially a symbol of comfort, Sara
                                    becomes a representation of Simon’s unresolved guilt and
                                    emotional pain.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mirrors:</strong> Symbolize self-reflection and the

                                <li><strong>The Knife:</strong> Represents Simon’s self-destructive

                            <p><em>Cry of Fear</em> offers a psychological horror experience that
                                uses its narrative, themes, and symbolism to explore mental health,
                                trauma, and self-acceptance. The game’s atmosphere and storyline
                                invite players to delve into the protagonist's mind, challenging
                                them to confront the darkest aspects of human psychology.</p>

                    <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
                    <h3>Survival Horror</h3>
                    <p><b>Limited Resources:</b> Scarce ammunition, healing syringes, and a limited
                        inventory creates a constant worry over carrying too many unnecessary items.
                        A scarcity of items forces you to be strategic and plan how to go about
                        combat in the game.</p>
                    <p><b>Exploration:</b><em> Cry of Fear</em> has levels that require a thorough
                        search of dark cooridors, abandoned buildings, and outdoor environments.
                        Clues are scattered throughtout the maps in the forms of notes, visual
                        clues, or locked doors (Ex. "This door requires a code"). This makes
                        exploration essential in order to decipher clues and unlock hidden
                        items.</p>
                    <img src="images/townCOF.jpg" alt="Town portion of gameplay" class="game-image" />
                    <h3>Combat</h3>
                    <p><b>Weaponary:</b> Weapons in <em>Cry of Fear</em> range from knives and
                        hammers, to firearms like pistols and shotguns. You have the ability to
                        dual-weild certain weapons allowing you to use your flashlight in one hand
                        while weilding a weapon in the other. This methof however sacrifices
                        accuracy for convienence of visibility.</p>
                    <img src="images/inviCOF.webp" alt="Inventory" class="game-image" />
                    <p><b>Enemies:</b> Enemies are gross, nightmarish, zombie-like manifestations
                        that are tied to Simon's mental state. Each encounter with the monsters was
                        terrifying. These enemies have erratic movements as the player you are
                        tasked with deciding to fight and waste resources or run.</p>
                    <img src="images/enemiesCOF.webp" alt="enemy list" class="game-image" />
                    <h3>Mechanics</h3>
                    <p><b>Phone Torch:</b> The map is shrouded in darkness, making the flashlight an
                        essential tool for survival. However, the flashlight’s limited range leaves
                        much of the environment in shadow, enhancing fear of the unknown.</p>
                    <p><b>Stamina:</b> Running depletes Simon’s stamina, which takes time to
                        regenerate. Low stamina slows Simon down, making him more vulnerable to
                        enemy attacks. This forces players to carefully manage movement, choosing
                        when to flee and when to stand their ground.</p>
                    <img src="images/intromon.jpeg" alt="HUD circled in red" class="game-image" />
                    <p><b>Sanity</b> As Simon’s psychological state deteriorates, the game reflects
                        this through disorienting visual effects, eerie sounds, and sudden,
                        unnerving changes in the environment. Rooms may appear different upon
                        re-entry, and subtle hallucinations keep you on edge.</p>

                    </video>
                    <h3>Puzzles</h3>
                    <p>Progression often requires solving puzzles, such as deciphering cryptic
                        notes, finding keys, or figuring out how to unlock doors. These puzzles test
                        your observational skills and logic, adding a cerebral layer to the
                        gameplay.</p>
                    <h3>Unique Features</h3>
                    <p><b>Mobile Phone:</b> Simon’s phone acts as a multipurpose tool, serving as a
                        flashlight, map, and communication device. Eerie, unexpected text messages
                        and phone calls add to the horror atmosphere.</p>
                    <p><b>Co-Op Mode:</b> A multiplayer option allows up to four players to team up
                        and face unique challenges together. Although it changes the dynamic, it
                        retains the horror tone and encourages teamwork. I did not get to try out
                        this method but perhaps in the future I will.</p>
                    <p><b>Replayability:</b> Player choices throughout the game—such as how they
                        interact with NPCs or their approach to combat—affect the outcome of the
                        story. This encourages multiple playthroughs to experience the full
                        narrative and uncover alternate endings.</p>
